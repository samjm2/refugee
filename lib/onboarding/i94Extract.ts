// Shared, server-safe extraction logic for the onboarding document reader.
//
// This module is PURE (no network, no DB, no Next): it owns the vision prompt
// and the parse/validate/derive step so the exact same logic can be unit-tested
// against real document fixtures (scripts/test-i94-extraction.mjs) and reused by
// the API route (app/api/onboarding/extract/route.ts).
//
// Field-mapping safety is the whole point of this file:
//   • Each field is validated to its own type (ISO date, enum, …).
//   • Dates are confined to their OWN slot — a date of birth can never be read
//     off an entry/issue/expiry date, and vice-versa.
//   • A cross-field guard demotes a date_of_birth that collides with an
//     arrival / eligibility / status-grant date to "low" confidence, because a
//     birth date equal to an entry date is almost certainly a mis-read. The
//     client then leaves low-confidence fields blank for manual entry.

export const EXTRACT_PROMPT = `You are a careful, privacy-preserving document reader for a U.S. refugee benefits navigator. The user uploaded one or more photos/scans of their immigration documents to speed up onboarding.

For EACH image, first classify the document as one of: i94, ead (Employment Authorization Document / Form I-766 work permit), green_card (Form I-551 permanent resident card), asylum_letter (asylum approval / I-797 approval notice / immigration judge grant), ssn_card (Social Security card), other.

Then extract ONLY the fields listed below, across all documents combined. Read what is ACTUALLY printed on the document — transcribe characters exactly, do not normalize names, and never invent or "fill in" a value you cannot clearly see. If a field is missing, blurry, or absent on the document, OMIT it rather than guessing.

A CBP I-94 (Arrival/Departure Record) is the most common document here. On it, read these labeled areas precisely:
- "Family Name" (surname) and "First (Given) Name" — combine them into full_name as "First Last" (Given name first, then Family name).
- "Birth Date" — the person's date of birth.
- "Admission (I-94) Record Number" — this is a record number, NOT a date and NOT an A-Number; do NOT output it (it is not one of the requested fields).
- "Class of Admission" — the short letter/number code (e.g. "RE", "AS", "SI", "U4U") that determines immigration_status (see mapping below).
- "Country of Citizenship" / "Country of Issuance" — use for country_of_origin.
- "Most Recent Date of Entry" / "Date of Entry" — use for arrival_date.

NEVER output, transcribe, or guess any of these (they are sensitive and not needed): Social Security Number, A-Number / Alien Registration Number, USCIS number, passport number, bank/financial numbers. If a Social Security card is uploaded, classify it as ssn_card and extract NOTHING from it.

CRITICAL — keep dates in their correct field. These are DIFFERENT dates and must never be swapped:
- date_of_birth = the person's BIRTH date (labels: "Birth Date", "Date of Birth", "DOB"). It is in the past, usually decades ago.
- arrival_date = the date of ADMISSION / ENTRY to the U.S. (labels: "Most Recent Date of Entry", "Date of Entry", "Admission Date"). This is NOT the birth date.
- status_grant_date = the date refugee/asylee status was granted.
- An "Admit Until Date" / expiration / issue date is NOT any of the above — do not map it.
If a value is only legible as one of these, fill that one field and leave the others out. Never copy the entry date into date_of_birth or vice-versa. If you are unsure which date a value is, mark it "low" confidence.

Fields to extract (omit any you cannot read):
- immigration_status: map the document to EXACTLY one of these codes, driven primarily by the "Class of Admission" code on an I-94, the category code on an EAD/green card, or the explicit grant on a letter. Only assign a status when the document's evidence clearly supports it; otherwise use other_none. Map by the code you actually saw:
    refugee_207  (I-94 class of admission RE / R8 / "Visa 93" / "Refugee"; EAD category A03; green card category RE-6/RE-7)
    asylee_208   (asylum granted / I-94 "AS"; EAD category A05; green card AS-6/AS-7; asylum approval letter)
    siv          (Special Immigrant Visa; I-94 "SI"/"SQ"/"IV")
    afghan_parolee     (parole tied to Afghanistan / "OAR" / Operation Allies Welcome)
    ukrainian_parolee  ("U4U" / Uniting for Ukraine / "UHP")
    cuban_haitian_entrant
    trafficking_victim (T nonimmigrant)
    amerasian
    lpr_from_humanitarian  (a GREEN CARD whose category shows refugee/asylee/humanitarian origin, e.g. RE-6, AS-6)
    lpr_other              (a green card from any other category)
    us_citizen
    other_none             (cannot tell)
  Include the literal code/text you saw in "evidence".
- date_of_birth (YYYY-MM-DD)
- arrival_date (YYYY-MM-DD) — date of admission/entry, typically from an I-94
- eligibility_date (YYYY-MM-DD) — for a refugee this equals the date of admission; for an asylee this equals the asylum grant date
- status_grant_date (YYYY-MM-DD) — date refugee/asylee status was granted (asylum letters/I-797)
- full_name (display only)
- country_of_origin (display only)

Give EVERY extracted field its own confidence: "high" (clearly printed and unambiguous on the document), "medium" (legible but inferred, partial, or reconstructed), or "low" (blurry, partly obscured, ambiguous, or guessed). Be honest — if you had to guess any part of a value, it is "low". Do not mark a value "high" unless you can read every character of it cleanly.

Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose, in EXACTLY this shape (omit fields you cannot read; never include fields not listed):

    "immigration_status": { "value": "refugee_207", "confidence": "high", "evidence": "Class of admission: RE" },
